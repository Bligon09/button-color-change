# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This project is a REACT based project that is built using Vite. 

This project was build using REACT 18.2.0

To get started with Vite, go to this website: https://v3.vitejs.dev/guide/

You will find a line to put into your terminal: npm create vite@latest

Enter that line into your terminal and follow the steps.
